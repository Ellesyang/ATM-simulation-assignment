RENDI2S departure: flights do not climb fast enough -> flights do not cross waypoints at given altitude and speed
KUDAD3S departure: flights cross KUDAD at FL180 with SPD 323 knots - Should be FL190 with SPD 330 knots
SPY4K departure: flights do not climb fast enough -> flights do not cross waypoints at given altitude and speed
LOPIK3S departure: flights do not climb fast enough initially, but reach LOPIK at correct alt and speed (FL110, 320). Next waypoint not reached at correct alt and speed (TOTNA FL190, 330 -> now FL175 320)

Flights on KUDAD3S Enter sector south near PESER at FL180, SPD 323 knots
Flights on LOPIK3S ENTER sector south at middle of diagonal sector boundary

Flights on RENDI2S Enter sector east between IVLUT and LUNIX at FL130, SPD 345 knots

Flights on SPY4K Enter sector app at EH056 at FL45, SPD 220 knots, will cross 18R (FL50) + 18C (FL65) next waypoint is SPY (FL140 but now FL90) then ANDIK (FL190) and KEKIX (FL210)

For some reason it is hard for flights to cross waypoints at the given altitude. Most departure cross 10 or 25 Flightlevels below
